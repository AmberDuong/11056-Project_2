                                    Red Notice is a 2021 American action comedy film written and directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber starring Dwayne Johnson alongside Ryan Reynolds and Gal Gadot and Ritu Arya. It marks the third collaboration between Thurber and Johnson, following Central Intelligence (2016) and Skyscraper (2018). In the film, an FBI agent reluctantly teams up with a renowned art robber in order to catch an even more notorious robber.<br><br>
                                    An Interpol-issued red notice is a global alert to hunt and capture the world’s most wanted. But when a daring heist brings together the FBI’s top profiler (Johnson) and two rival criminals (Gadot, Reynolds), there’s no telling what will happen.

                                    Don't Look Up is a 2021 American apocalyptic political satire black comedy film written, co-produced, and directed by Adam McKay from a story he co-wrote with David Sirota. It stars an ensemble cast featuring Leonardo DiCaprio, Jennifer Lawrence, Rob Morgan, Jonah Hill, Mark Rylance, Tyler Perry, Timothée Chalamet, Ron Perlman, Ariana Grande, Scott Mescudi, Himesh Patel, Melanie Lynskey, Cate Blanchett, and Meryl Streep. The film tells the story of two astronomers attempting to warn humanity about an approaching comet that will destroy human civilization. The impact event is an allegory for climate change, and the film is a satire of government, political, celebrity, and media indifference to the climate crisis.<br><br>                                
                                    Kate Dibiasky (Jennifer Lawrence), an astronomy grad student, and her professor Dr. Randall Mindy (Leonardo DiCaprio) make an astounding discovery of a comet orbiting within the solar system. The problem - it's on a direct collision course with Earth. The other problem? No one really seems to care. Turns out warning mankind about a planet-killer the size of Mount Everest is an inconvenient fact to navigate. With the help of Dr. Oglethorpe (Rob Morgan), Kate and Randall embark on a media tour that takes them from the office of an indifferent President Orlean (Meryl Streep) and her sycophantic son and Chief of Staff, Jason (Jonah Hill), to the airwaves of The Daily Rip, an upbeat morning show hosted by Brie (Cate Blanchett) and Jack (Tyler Perry). With only six months until the comet makes impact, managing the 24-hour news cycle and gaining the attention of the social media obsessed public before it's too late proves shockingly comical - what will it take to get the world to just look up?

                                    Sex Education is a British comedy-drama streaming television series created by Laurie Nunn for Netflix. It follows the lives of the students, staff and parents of the fictional Moordale Secondary School as they contend with various personal dilemmas, often related to sexual intimacy. The series stars an ensemble cast that includes Asa Butterfield, Gillian Anderson, Ncuti Gatwa, Emma Mackey, Connor Swindells, Kedar Williams-Stirling, Alistair Petrie, Mimi Keene, and Aimee Lou Wood.<br><br>
                                    Sex Education primarily follows Otis Milburn, a student at Moordale Secondary School. Otis begins the series ambivalent about sex, in part because his single mother, Jean, is a sex therapist who frequently has affairs with male suitors but does not maintain romantic relationships.

                                    Love Destiny: The Movie, known in Thai as Bupphesanniwat 2 (Thai: บุพเพสันนิวาส 2, 'Love Destiny 2') is a 2022 Thai historical romance film directed by Adisorn Tresirikasem. It is co-produced by GDH 559 and Broadcast Thai Television, and is one of the two sequel projects to the highly successful 2018 television drama Love Destiny, the other being the TV drama Love Destiny 2. The film stars Ranee Campen and Thanavat Vatthanaputi, who play 19th-century Rattanakosin-era reincarnations of their characters from the original drama, which was set in the Ayutthaya Kingdom of the 17th century. The film was released on 28 July 2022.<br><br>
                                    After settling down together and only being separated in death during the Ayutthaya era (1351-1767 CE), Dej and Karaket are reborn in the early Rattanakosin period (1782-1855 CE). But there is only one of them who still believes in 'destiny'. Bhop, a chief engineer with the sweetest smile in Siam, has been seeing the same lady in his dreams for many years. He believes wholeheartedly that she is his destined soulmate. When Bhop meets Gaysorn who looks exactly like the girl in his dreams, Bhop follows her around, trying to win her heart. However, Gaysorn has a progressive attitude and does not believe in destiny. Gaysorn clearly expresses that she dislikes Bhop, but she is interested in Mathus, a Thai-Western man who uses strange slang when speaking, which happens to match the messages in an old journal of Lady Karaket. Did Mathus travel back in time from the future like Lady Karaket?. Their relationships have not been figured out, yet when Bhop, Gaysorn, and Mathus get caught up in a chaotic historical event, things get out of hand and could lead to a war that will change history forever. Where will destiny lead them?

                                    The Platform (Spanish: El hoyo, transl. The Hole) is a 2019 Spanish social science fiction horror film directed by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia. The film is set in a large, tower-style "Vertical Self-Management Center." Its residents, who are switched every month between its many floors, are fed via a platform which, initially filled with food at the top floor, gradually descends through the tower's levels, stopping for a fixed amount of time on each. The system inevitably leads to conflict, as the residents at the top levels get to eat as much as they can, with each level getting only the leftovers from the previous ones.<br><br>
                                    Goreng wakes in a concrete cell marked with the number 48. His cellmate, Trimagasi, explains that they are in "The Pit", a tower-style facility in which food is delivered via a platform that travels from the top-down, halting for a fixed period on each floor. People on lower levels can eat only what those above leave and are subjected to fatal temperatures if they keep the food. Prisoners are randomly reassigned to a new level each month. Trimagasi reveals that when assigned to level 132, he and his former cellmate cannibalized a resident who had fallen down the shaft. One day, a bloodied woman named Miharu rides down on the platform, whom Trimagasi explains descends the pit every month searching for her child.

                                    Tag is a 2018 American comedy film directed by Jeff Tomsic (in his feature directorial debut) and written by Rob McKittrick and Mark Steilen. The film is based on a true story that was published in The Wall Street Journal about a group of men, played by Ed Helms, Jake Johnson, Hannibal Buress, Jon Hamm, and Jeremy Renner, who had spent one month a year playing the game of tag since their childhood.<br><br>
                                    Hogan "Hoagie" Malloy, Bob Callahan, Randy "Chilli" Cilliano, Kevin Sable and Jerry Pierce have been playing tag since 1983 during the month of May, with Jerry being the only member of the group who has not been tagged. Hoagie recruits Bob, Chilli and Kevin for one last attempt to tag Jerry, telling them that Jerry plans to retire after this year's game because of his upcoming marriage. Rebecca Crosby, a Wall Street Journal reporter doing a piece on Bob, joins them and decides to write an article on the friends. They are also accompanied by Hoagie's wife Anna.

                                    Knives Out is a 2019 American mystery film written, directed, and co-produced by Rian Johnson. It follows master detective Benoit Blanc investigating the death of the patriarch of a wealthy, dysfunctional family.

                                    The family of Harlan Thrombey, a wealthy mystery novelist, attends his 85th birthday party at his Massachusetts mansion. His housekeeper, Fran, finds him dead the next morning with his throat slit. The police believe Harlan's death to be suicide, but private detective Benoit Blanc is anonymously hired to investigate. Blanc learns Harlan had strained relationships with his family, having made threats that day to his son-in-law Richard and daughter-in-law Joni, fired his son Walt, and had an argument with his grandson Ransom.
